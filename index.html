        <h2>New to coding, but with years of experience.</h2> 
        <h3>Here's what I mean:</h3>
   	 		<div class="half-width">
          <p>After 15+ years at large Wall Street firms, I handed in my spreadsheets for the chance to stay at home with my two children. In my last role at Barclays Capital in London, I'd made a jump from Finance to Technology and after a very short time in that new role, I felt like I'd been missing out on my true calling - just as I was leaving on what turned out to be a permanent maternity leave!  </p>
   	 		</div>

   	 		<div class="half-width">
          <p>I immediately started thinking about learning to code but never had the time to commit to it when the kids were small and whilst in the midst of a trans-Atlantic move. With the children now at school, I've finally found the time to dive in and I <strong>love</strong> it!  There aren't enough hours in the day to learn all that I want to, but everyday makes a difference and I know this is exactly what I want to do (and do very well!). </p>

          <h3>Hand-coded HTML</h3>
            <p>My focus is on learning to write clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

          <h3>Well-organized CSS</h3>
            <p>My utmost goal is to write CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

          <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
            <p>I'm becoming quite skilled at taking a designerâ€™s PSD and quickly and accurately converting it into a webpage or email that is nearly a pixel-perfect match.</p>
